**Introduction**

The project focuses on image classification within the animal domain, specifically cat image classification. Image processing is crucial in this domain as it enhances the features of images, improving model training and accuracy. The dataset consists of labeled cat images that were preprocessed and analyzed using various image processing techniques before feeding them into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This process helps in extracting essential features like edges and patterns, making it easier for the model to distinguish between different classes.

**Flow Diagram**

Below is the workflow of the project:

1. **Image Loading and Preprocessing**: Load images and apply necessary image processing.
2. **Image Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset by applying various transformations.
3. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model with original and processed images.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on different versions of processed images.

**Image Preprocessing Methods Used**

1. **Contrast Enhancement**: Enhances the contrast of images to make specific features stand out. In this project, contrast was increased by 1.5 times to emphasize key differences.
2. **Gaussian Blur**: Reduces fine details by applying a blur. This helps the model focus on larger shapes rather than small, irrelevant details.
3. **Edge Enhancement**: Highlights the edges in the image to make boundaries more noticeable, allowing the model to focus on structural features of objects.

Each preprocessing method is applied to enhance image features selectively, allowing the CNN model to learn more robustly from varied data.

**Model Used: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

The CNN model used for this project consists of several convolutional layers followed by a dense layer for binary classification (e.g., distinguishing between cats and non-cats). The structure is as follows:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features like edges, textures, and patterns.
- **Dense Layer**: Uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
- **Optimizer and Loss Function**: Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss, optimal for binary classification tasks.

The CNN was trained on both original and preprocessed images to compare accuracy and determine the most effective preprocessing techniques.

**Pseudo Code of the Process**

\# Step 1: Import necessary libraries

\# Step 2: Set up logging for tracking corrupted images

set up logging

\# Step 3: Define a function to load images with error handling

\# Step 4: Preprocess images based on selected processing technique

if apply_processing == "contrast":

increase contrast

elif apply_processing == "blur":

apply gaussian blur

elif apply_processing == "edge":

enhance edges

\# Step 5: Resize and normalize images

resize image to (224, 224)

normalize image

\# Step 6: Define CNN model

define CNN model with Conv2D and Dense layers

\# Step 7: Train and evaluate model

for each processing technique:

train CNN model with processed images

evaluate and record accuracy

**Comparative Results**

| **Processing Technique** | **Accuracy (%)** |
| --- | --- |
| Original | 50  |
| Contrast Enhancement | 50  |
| Gaussian Blur | 50  |
| Edge Enhancement | 50  |

_Interpretation_: The accuracy stayed the same due to overfitting on artificial patterns introduced by preprocessing. These altered features caused the model to focus on processed images, reducing its ability to generalize to unaltered images. The unrealistic data distribution from preprocessing further impacted performance on normal images.
